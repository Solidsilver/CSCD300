Circular and Doubly linked List
 - In each node, we have three fields
	1) next link (pointing to successor of this node)
	2) data element
	3) prev link (pointing to the predecessor of this node)
 - The next link of the last element points to head
 - The prev link of the dummy(first) node points to the last node

 - Before making something for a circular doubly linked list, draw a diagram!
   Figure out the logic first.
